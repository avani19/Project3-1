Polly is a place in the clouds where users can visit to browse polls.  If user wants to create, rank, share or favorite a poll they need to create a profile.  Once the profile is created, users can log in safely and create their own polls, and even obseve their own polling activity in the **user dashboard**.

Users can cast **only one vote** on every poll, and edit their own with limited access (*we would not like anyone deleting our vote*).

**Opinion matters!**  In that respect, users can leave comments on each of the polls. Polly enables users to rank polls by clicking the thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons.  If a poll is of a special meaning users can add and mark their favorites.

**Social Media** Each of the poll can be shared on Facebook and Twitted, and saved as a pin on Pintrest.

**All data persists.**

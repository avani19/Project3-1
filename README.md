##Polly

Polly is a place in the clouds where users can log in safely and create their own polls.
Users can cast a vote on every poll, and edit their own with limited access (we would not like anyone deleting our vote). Opinion matters!
In that respect, users can leave comments on each of the polls.
Polly enables users to rank polls and add mark their favorites.
Users have their own dashboard.
All data persists.
